               <h2>Bio</h2>
               <p>I've always found art an excellent release for any negatively charged emotions I was feeling. At a very early age, I found my love of drawing. I used to doodle for hours, mostly aimlessly. I would imagine these strange creatures from the depths of my mind. As I got older, I found my interests evolving into replicating my favorite characters from tv and movie. I remember a time where I did a large-scale reproduction of Scar&reg; from Disney's The Lion King&copy;. I was obsessed with almost every Disney Villain. I think it was their awesome theme songs and the fact that they were usually the misfits of their families and friends.      </p>

               </figure>
               <p>After high school, I did a lot more investigation and found a lot of the motivations behind some of my most favorite villains. Let's take Ursula&reg;, from Disney's The Little Mermaid&copy;, as an example. The character's designers took inspiration from one of the filthiest Drag Queens of our time, the late and great Lady Divine.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>Of course, that drew me down a rabbit of learning and exploring more of the world of Drag and how it challenges gender norms and the idea of gender being a construct. I learned my deep love and understanding of these characters and felt connected to them in ways that I was never connected to all the princes and princesses of the Disney fandom.</p>

            <p>
               In my personal time, I enjoy participating in a few activities. I've always found art an excellent release for any negatively charged emotions I was feeling. At a very early age, I found my love of drawing. I used to doodle for hours, mostly aimlessly. I would imagine these strange creatures from the depths of my mind. As I got older, I found my interests evolving into replicating my favorite characters from tv and movie. I remember a time where I did a large-scale reproduction of Scar from Disney's The Lion King. I was obsessed with almost every Disney Villain. I think it was their awesome theme songs.      </p>

               After high school, I did a lot more investigation and found a lot of the motivations behind some of my most favorite villains. Let's take Ursula, from Disney's The Little Mermaid, as an example. The characters designers took inspiration from one of the filthiest Drag Queens of our time, the late and great Lady Divine.

               Of course, that drew me down a rabbit of learning and exploring more of the world of Drag and how it challenges gender norms and the idea of gender being a construct. I learned my deep love and understanding of these characters and felt connected to them in ways that I was never connected to all the princes and princesses of the Disney fandom.
